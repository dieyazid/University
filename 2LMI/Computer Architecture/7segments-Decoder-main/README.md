# Before runing the code you probably should read this
this program contain three parts
1-part one "The first choice in the Menu" is the incrementer
it's a logic circuit 
how's it works?
we have a & b let's take a=0 & b=0 
the incrementer will incremente a so it will be a=1 (not a "!a")
in the other side b=0 (b= a & !b | !a & b)
2-part two 
7 segments decoder 
It's a Digital Decoder IC, is a device which converts one digital format into another and one of the most commonly used devices for doing this is called the Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) to 7-Segment Display Decoder. ... In electronics there are two important types of 7-segment LED digital display.
3-part three
